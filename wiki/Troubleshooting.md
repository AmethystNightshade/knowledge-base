## Troubleshooting Steps

- Make sure our [LUG Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper)'s Preflight Check passes all checks
- Run Lutris in debug mode to see more verbose logging. Native: `lutris -d` Flatpak: `flatpak run net.lutris.Lutris -d`
- Look for your issue in the [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#news) and the list of common issues below
- Ask for help on our [social channels](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#welcome-space-penguins)

#### Important System Settings

- Make sure the `SDL_VIDEODRIVER` environment variable is **NOT** set globally to `wayland` on your system. This causes incompatibilities with many games. If it is, simply unset it.

## üíæ Install & Update Problems

#### Launcher hangs during installation
- In Lutris, try setting `Prefer system libraries` to `Off` globally before installation. After installation, this can be reset and configured only for Star Citizen if desired.


#### Install button does nothing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Launch Lutris in debug mode (`lutris -d`) and look for a `KeyError: 'contentstatsid'` error.
- If the error is present, check your Lutris version. This is fixed in v0.5.11. https://lutris.net/downloads


#### Error: *utf-8 codec can't decode byte 0x_ in position ___: invalid continuation byte*
- Re-check your EAC workaround. Our [Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper) can check it for you, or see the [manual instructions](Tips-and-Tricks#easy-anti-cheat-workaround) on our wiki.


#### Installing Star Citizen on an NTFS-formatted drive
- See: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Using-a-NTFS-disk-with-Linux-and-Windows

## üí• Crashes

#### RSI Launcher v1.6.2+ JavaScript error
- For more information, see [CIG's announcement in Spectrum](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/upcoming-launcher-update-for-linux-users/5693728)
- Solution 1:
   - `Right click the game->Configure->Game options` add `--no-sandbox` to the Arguments
   - In `System options`, make sure Advanced options is on then enable `CLI mode`
- Solution 2:
  - If this does not fix the problem, revert the above changes and install the latest GloriousEggroll runner, available in our [Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper)


#### Code 3 crash with error: *Star Citizen process exited abnormally (code: 3) : Command failed*
- You are likely missing 32bit drivers. Make sure the following packages are installed (names may vary depending on your distro)
  - Nvidia: `lib32-nvidia-utils`
  - AMD: `lib32-mesa` and `lib32-vulkan-radeon`
- Additionally, explicitly set the Vulkan ICD loader in Lutris to either `Nvidia Proprietary` or `AMD RADV Open Source`
  - Right click the game -> Configure -> System options -> Vulkan ICD loader
- If you are using the Flatpak Lutris, you may need to resync it with your system after installing the 32bit drivers. Run: `flatpak update`


#### Game immediately crashes after clicking 'Launch'
- Start by checking the Wine output and/or "game.log" file

- Possible cause 1: DXVK
  - Make sure DXVK is enabled in Lutris' Runner options.
  - Some people report changing their DXVK version fixes this. Try using our [Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper) to download an async DXVK.
  - Nvidia users, check our [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#news) for gpu driver issues, necessary workarounds, and currently recommended runner/DXVK versions.
  - DXVK installation instructions are available on our wiki [here](Performance-Tuning#dxvk-async).

- Possible cause 2: Incorrect Vulkan ICD Loader
  - If you have Intel integrated graphics and see `VK_ICD_FILENAMES="/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/intel_hasvk_icd.x86_64.json` in your log, then change the Vulkan ICD Loader in Lutris to use your discrete GPU:
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3657071/221420185-c1f1e346-b67f-4cd9-ba14-748668a266ed.png)

- Possible cause 3: Phantom joystick
  - Many keyboards and mice can also have a "joystick" part in Linux, which Wine can detect. Unfortunately, Wine may be confused about it, as they are not real joysticks. In this case, the game could crash. Try running the Wine joystick control panel "wine control" (in Lutris: right click -> Joystick configuration) and disable your keyboard and/or mice.
  - This will not affect how your keyboard and mice work in the game.


#### Game crashes after clicking 'Verify'
- Make sure Star Citizen is installed on drive "C:\" Check the "Library Folder" option in the launcher settings:  
![Star Citizen launcher](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/608349808956276737/927652866389340310/Screenshot_from_2022-01-03_14-56-37.png)
- Additionally, make sure the wine prefix is not installed on an NTFS formatted partition.


#### Game crashes with "STATUS_CRYENGINE_FATAL_ERROR" in game.log
- Some penguins have had success changing the Windows compatibility from Win10 to Win8.1 in the Wine configuration. Select Star Citizen in Lutris, then click the Wine button at the bottom and select `Wine configuration`:  
![](https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/zKGOXxMOsktqYKqevqeSvYSw)  
- In the Wine configuration, under the `Applications` tab, change `Windows version` to `Windows 8.1`


#### Game crashes with " 00adntdll:FILE_GetNtStatus Converting errno 12 to STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL "
- Make sure you have set your vm.max_map_count as described in the installation section.


#### After playing for a while, game/lutris/wine crash, no errors
  - If there are no errors in your game logs, check your system logs. It may be an Out Of Memory situation. Create a larger [swap file](Performance-Tuning#swap).


#### Game crashes when going to Lorville / ArcCorp or crashes often when launching
- Make sure you followed the guide to install Wine's dependencies and set your vm.max_map_count as described in the installation section.

## üßä Freezes

#### Game hangs at splash screen or black/transparent window after clicking 'Launch'
- Make sure DXVK is enabled in Lutris' Runner options.
- Try changing to a different DXVK version in the Lutris settings.  Alternate DXVKs can be quickly installed using our [LUG Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper).
- Nvidia users, check our [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#news) for gpu driver issues, necessary workarounds, and currently recommended runner/DXVK versions.
- DXVK installation instructions are available on our wiki [here](Performance-Tuning#dxvk-async).


#### Launcher freezes within a few seconds of opening
- Try using a different runner. Ask on Spectrum or in our social channels which runner is currently recommended.
- Alternatively, you can try changing "Prefer system libraries" to ON, although this may have other side effects.
  - Right click the game -> Configure -> System options -> Prefer system libraries


#### Launch Game stuck at "launching..."
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Launch Lutris in debug mode (`lutris -d`) and look for a `KeyError: 'contentstatsid'` error.
- If the error is present, check your Lutris version. This is fixed in v0.5.11. https://lutris.net/downloads


#### Launcher hangs / stops responding / crashes with an "ASAR" error
- Some people report the launcher hanging in combination with the Lutris runtime. If you are on Lutris, try toggling "Disable Lutris runtime" under "System options" of the Lutris game options.
- If you do need to disable the Lutris runtime, the Lutris guys would like to have a log file to debug the issue. You can run lutris -d from the terminal after enabling Wine debugging as per this image:  
![Enable Wine debugging](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/imager/Xeh-bNe8P9_WE60v7iLpmeXXLzI=/fit-in/400x400/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/540589766811451392/558481590687236096/Peek_2019-03-22_05-43.gif)
- And send a log to @beniwtv on Spectrum or send it to Lutris developers in the Lutris Discord.

## ü§™ Unexpected Behavior (sometimes also crashes)

#### Empty launcher
- Log out log back in, or reset the launcher by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R


#### Visual glitches or semi-transparent lines, poor performance, possibly random crashes
- DXVK is likely disabled in Lutris's Runner options. Make sure it is enabled.

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/608349808956276737/1070664567425871960/SC_Lines.jpg)


#### No sound in game
- Penguins on rolling release distributions (ie. Arch, Manjaro) may need to set `Prefer System Libraries` in Lutris to `ON`.
- If you have sound in the launcher but not in the game, launch the game and go to your audio settings, then enable "Play sound while game is in background".


#### Black or flickering window, possible crash with errors 15006 or 30007
- Check for larger resolutions and scaling settings.  See CIG's [support article](https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000081887-Guide-to-Graphic-Issues#large-res)


#### Black/transparent window after clicking 'Launch'
- Make sure DXVK is enabled in Lutris' Runner options.
- Try changing to a different DXVK version in the Lutris settings.  Alternate DXVKs can be quickly installed using our [LUG Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper).
- Nvidia users, check our [latest news](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/knowledge-base/wiki#news) for gpu driver issues, necessary workarounds, and currently recommended runner/DXVK versions.
- DXVK installation instructions are available on our wiki [here](Performance-Tuning#dxvk-async).


#### Launcher white screen / error DCompositionCreateDevice
- In Lutris, configure Star Citizen (right-click->Configure->Game options) and add `"--use-gl=osmesa"` to the Arguments field.
- If launching manually: `wine "RSI Launcher.exe" "--use-gl=osmesa"`
